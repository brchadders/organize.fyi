# NLRB election

An NLRB election is a process used to determine whether a majority of employees wish to be represented by a union.

In order to conduct an election, 30% of eligible employees must sign a petition (or a union card) expressing interest in forming a union.

A secret ballot election is conducted by the NLRB at the workplace once a bargaining unit has been agreed to.

Different types:

- _Mail secret ballot election_:
- _Manual secret ballot election_:
- _Mixed mail/manual secret ballot election_:

## What if I’m out sick or on FMLA or PTO on the day of the election? Are there absentee ballots?

No. The National Labor Relations Board does not allow absentee voting under any circumstances. If you are not a full-time remote employee, you must show up in person to cast your ballot.

## How many votes does it take to officially form a union?

It takes a majority (50% +1 vote) of those who vote to win your election.

## What happens next when the vote passes? How do contract negotiations work?

If the vote passes, you will have won the right to negotiate a legally binding contract that secures your rights at work. The first step in that process is that all members of the bargaining unit will elect a bargaining committee and commence contract negotiations. That committee, with the help of a seasoned representative from your union, will work with your company’s leadership to negotiate a contract, soliciting and incorporating feedback from union members throughout the process.

Once your union and your company’s leadership come to an agreement, every member of the bargaining unit will have the opportunity to vote on the contract. Only then—when the contract is finalized, voted on, and ratified—will the bargaining unit begin to pay dues. The average length of a union employment contract is around three years.
