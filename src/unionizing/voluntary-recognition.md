# Voluntary recognition

If more than 50% of eligible employees have indicated their interest in unionizing by signing a petition (or a union card), the employees can request voluntary recognition from their employer, who may then choose to waive the NLRB election.

In such cases, a neutral third party will then be called on to verifying majority support via a card check, confirming that all signatures are valid and do indeed make up 50% of eligible employees.
