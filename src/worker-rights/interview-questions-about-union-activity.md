# Interviewing union activity

Interviewees cannot be asked about labor affiliation with a labor organization.

Employers may not:

- Refuse to hire or consider job applicants because of their union membership, activities, or sympathies.
- Refuse to hire union-represented employees of a business you have acquired to avoid succeeding to an obligation to bargain with the union.
