# Laws

> The best way to think of the law is as a shield, not a sword. The law is not an especially good way to change things. But it can give you some real protection as you try to change things in other ways. The law can also act as a net that restrains or co-opts efforts by workers to make change on the job. Therefore an understanding of workplace law is a must for avoiding pitfalls to successful organizing.
